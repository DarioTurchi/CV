## About Me

I am an up-and-coming __software engineer__ with a strong academic background in __artificial intelligence__. I currently live in Athens, GA where I am pursuing a master's degree in AI at the University of Georgia. I have prior work experience both in industry and as a research assistant.

Feel free to browse my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cbarrick), but remember that [__GitHub is not my CV__](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/). I have many half-baked hobby projects and yaks to be shaved. But there should be enough there to give you an idea of my interests and languages/frameworks that I play with. I'm a big fan of Python, PyTorch, and Rust, and I prefer a shell to an IDE.

## About the Template

My resume uses the [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template by @posquit0 which uses the fonts [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto), [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro), and [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome). Compiling the PDFs probably requires [XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/).
